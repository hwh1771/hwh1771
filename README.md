# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a data science and economics undergraduate with experience mostly in Python. My work focuses on economic modelling, machine learning and time series analysis. Most of my repos include university-related projects.

## Projects
### [Beyond traditional GARCH models: integrating NLP-derived sentiment scores for enhanced volatility modeling](https://github.com/hwh1771/sentiment-analysis-volatility-forecasting)
- This is our university final year project, extending the base GARCH model by incorporating additional exogenous regressors into the volatility equation.
- Our project paper can be found [here](https://hdl.handle.net/10356/184324).

### [HE4045 Quantitative Economics with Data Science Project](https://github.com/hwh1771/he4045-project)
- Project for NTU's HE4045 (Quantitative Economics with Data Science) module. 
- We conduct data analysis on the causes of income inequality in China using an ARIMAX time-series model, before conducting simulations using suitable macroeconomic models to forecast future inequality under various scenarios.

## Education
- B.Sc. in Economics and Data Science | Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore
